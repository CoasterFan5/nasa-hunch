			"Sewn Flight Articles", also known as Softgoods, allows students to use soft materials to
			create various goods requested by different NASA centers and the International Space Station
			Astronaut Crew. From redesigning the crew pantry to creating kits for the Crewâ€™s personal
			items, Softgoods provides a unique design opportunity using various materials to keep the crew
			not only safe but clean and comfortable aboard their stay.
		</p>

			Much of the output goes to items for training purposes. By creating high fidelity training
			goods, the Astronaut Crew can have a more realistic simulation while they are on the ground.
			These products range from items designed through Design and Prototyping and flown up to the
			International Space Station, to items that already exist aboard the International Space
			Station such as Cargo Bags. This range of items allows schools with different skill levels to
			all participate so that no one is denied the chance to create.
		</p>
		<p>Some items include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hygiene kits</li>
			<li>Cargo transfer bags</li>
			<li>Sleeping bag liners</li>
			<li>A modular shelving system and personal storage organizers</li>
			<li>A privacy curtain for hygiene activities</li>
			<li>Emergency bags for training and flight</li>
			<li>Storage bags for dry trash disposal</li>
			<li>Desiccant bags to help control moisture on the ISS</li>
			<li>Trash containers to hold disposable bags of trash and help control odor</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Since most items are built to drawing specifications, they need to show the highest quality
			output possible from our schools. We teach students about quality assurance best practices so
			that they learn to expect quality from all of the items they create. They are also shown
			proper safety documentation throughout the process making them more accountable for their
			output insuring tractability from start to finish. We want to insure that all HUNCH products
			meet the highest quality standards possible so that student work has the best chance of
			reaching the International Space Station.
