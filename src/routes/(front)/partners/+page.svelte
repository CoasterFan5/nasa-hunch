					teach other students what I knew about machining and engineering. This, without a doubt,
					helped me get my job at Sam Houston."

					truly been influential accomplishments for me, other students and to the space program.
					Given my invaluable experience, regardless of the career path that you pick or the
					interest that you may have, the HUNCH program instills students with the knowledge and
					expertise that will lead to a promising future."
