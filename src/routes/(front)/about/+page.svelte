<Section title="Goals">
	<p>
		We aim to equip and motivate high school students through hands-on, project-based learning,
		enabling them to acquire contemporary skills allowing them to begin their careers by designing
		and producing real-world, valuable products for NASA. We empower and inspire students through
		project-based learning where high school students learn modern skills, granting them the
		opportunity to launch their careers through designing and fabricating real-world, valued
		products for NASA. We want to expand the HUNCH program to more schools throughout the United
		States. However, this means that we need more volunteer mentors for our schools. Individuals
		knowledgeable in any of the following categories who have time to visit schools and mentor
		students are encouraged to apply.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are many different ways to join the HUNCH Program; from volunteering your time as a mentor
		to a local school, to becoming a HUNCH Teacher through the school district, or attending one of
		our Design Reviews across the country. The HUNCH program welcomes any and all interested persons
		or organizations to get involved in encouraging student STEM involvement through NASA HUNCH
		projects.

<Section title="History">
	<p>
		Sixteen years ago, we founded NASA HUNCH (High Schools United with NASA to Create Hardware) as a
		means of giving high school students new educational experiences by producing hardware training
		items for the International Space Station. Today, the program has grown from the first three
		schools in 2003 to well over 200 nationwide, participating in various projects ranging from
		industrial sewing to an astronaut Culinary Challenge.
	</p>
	<p>
		We mainly work to improve the lives of the International Space Station crew, from day-to-day
		personal items or tools to updating parts of the station from their original designs. HUNCH
		fills a unique niche for the International Space Station, providing high-quality training and
		flight parts to other NASA programs and partners by covering various topics. Through HUNCH,
		students have a unique opportunity to learn skills and make a real-world contribution to NASAâ€™s
		space missions. Join Us!
