          16 years ago, NASA HUNCH was founded as a means of giving high school students new
          educational experiences by producing <b>hardware training items</b> for the International
          Space Station. Today, the program has grown from the
          <i>three</i> schools in 2003 to well over <i>two hundred</i> schools all across the
          country participating in a wide variety of projects, ranging from
          <a href="/programs/sewn">industrial sewing</a>
          to <a href="/programs/culinary">designing food for astronauts</a>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We work to improve the lives of the International Space Station crew from day-to-day
          personal items or tools to updating parts of the station itself from their original
          designs. HUNCH fills a unique niche for the International Space Station, as well as
          providing high quality training and flight parts to other NASA programs and partners, by
          covering a wide range of topics. Through HUNCH, students have a unique opportunity to
          learn skills and have a real-world contribution to NASAâ€™s space missions. Join Us!
