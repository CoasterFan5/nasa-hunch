					16 years ago, NASA HUNCH (High Schools United with NASA to Create Hardware) was founded as
					a means of giving high school students new educational experiences by producing hardware
					training items for the International Space Station. Today, the program has grown from the
					first 3 schools in 2003 to well over 200 schools all across the country participating in a
					wide variety of projects, ranging from industrial sewing to an astronaut Culinary
					Challenge.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					We mainly work to improve the lives of the International Space Station crew from
					day-to-day personal items or tools to updating parts of the station itself from their
					original designs. HUNCH fills a unique niche for the International Space Station, as well
					as providing high quality training and flight parts to other NASA programs and partners,
					by covering a wide range of topics. Through HUNCH, students have a unique opportunity to
					learn skills and have a real-world contribution to NASAâ€™s space missions. Join Us!
