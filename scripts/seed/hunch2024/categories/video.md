# Video & Media

**Inspire** the next generation of explorers.

With the backing of ACTE (Association for Career and Technical Education), students can work on video projects that are used to inspire and educate new explorers about the work being done at NASA.

The importance of outreach through a common video-based medium is crucial to the success of NASA's mission. Students in the Video & Media program work on projects that are used to inspire and educate the next generation of explorers about the work being done at NASA.

The best videos are used in NASA's outreach efforts and are shown to students across the country in NASA and ACTE events.
