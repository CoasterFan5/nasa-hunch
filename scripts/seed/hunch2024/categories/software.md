**Develop** in the **horizon** of space.

Students work directly with **NASA** to build **cutting-edge** software for the **International Space Station**.

Software built by students helps solve real-world problems using the agile software engineering cycle, with teams focusing on programming, design, quality assurance, and testing.

Software remains a critical component of NASA, from powering mission-critical systems that power the ISS, to this student-created website that you are currently viewing. Students in the software program work on projects that are used by NASA and the astronauts aboard the ISS.
