Sew with the **stars**.

"Sewn Flight Articles", also known as Softgoods, allows students to use soft materials to
create various goods requested by different NASA centers and the International Space Station
Astronaut Crew. From redesigning the crew pantry to creating kits for the Crewâ€™s personal
items, Softgoods provides a unique design opportunity using various materials to keep the crew
not only safe but clean and comfortable aboard their stay.

Most items are for training purposes. By creating these training goods, the Astronauts have a
realistic simulation while they are on the ground. These products range from items designed
through Design and Prototyping and flown up to the International Space Station, to items that
already exist aboard the International Space Station such as Cargo Bags. This range of items
allows schools with different skill levels to all participate so that no one is denied the
chance to create.

Some items include:

- Hygiene kits
- Cargo transfer bags
- Sleeping bag liners
- A modular shelving system and personal storage organizers
- A privacy curtain for hygiene activities
- Emergency bags for training and flight
- Storage bags for dry trash disposal
- Desiccant bags to help control moisture on the ISS
- Trash containers to hold disposable bags of trash and help control odor

Since most items are built to drawing specifications, they need to show the highest quality
output possible from our schools. We teach students about quality assurance best practices so
that they learn to expect quality from all of the items they create. They are also shown
proper safety documentation throughout the process making them more accountable for their
output insuring tractability from start to finish. We want to insure that all HUNCH products
meet the highest quality standards possible so that student work has the best chance of
reaching the International Space Station.
