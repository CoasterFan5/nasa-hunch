Design the next idea **out of this world**.

All students can develop innovative solutions to problems in the International Space Station.
Many of the projects are items personally requested by the ISS Crew to ease living, giving
students the opportunity to make an impact on the lives of Astronauts. Others may come from
Flight Crew Systems and Operational groups at NASA that need more idea development.

This wide swath of student-led ideas allows us to pull in the best ideas at each center,
bringing students together nationwide to collaborate and present the very best they can offer
at our Design Reviews. This year, we are preparing a new schedule of design reviews to help
keep the process moving forward and bring the best ideas to the forefront. Our goal is to
bring the best ideas from each project together for a final review at Johnson Space Center.
