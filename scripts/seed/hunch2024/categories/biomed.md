Limit **risks**; Keep astronauts **safe**.

The sky is **not** the limit when thinking of **solutions** to keep astronauts safe & healthy in the **hazardous** environment of space.

In the Biomedical Science program, students work on projects that are designed to keep astronauts safe and healthy in space. These projects range from designing and building medical devices to creating exercise equipment that can be used in microgravity. Students work with NASA mentors to design, build, and test their projects to ensure they meet the rigorous standards required for use in space.
