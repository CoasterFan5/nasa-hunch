Astronauts on longâ€“duration
space missions will have increasing
potential for feelings of isolation, trouble
sleeping, and mental health issues
caused by environmental and
physiological changes.

## Come up with a new solution to help

Create a way to help mitigate problems
associated with potential mental health
issues in space especially on long duration
space flight. (This would also be called a
countermeasure).

- Look at sleep issues in space.
- Look at isolation issues in space.
- Look at technology we have today that might help with mental health.

## Sleep Issues

- Astronauts see 16 sunsets and 16 sunrises
- Circadiam Rhythm is off
- Primary lighting on Station is Blue light with certain wavelength
- Affects the hormone Melatonin
- Radiation hits to optic nerve and the crewmember sees flashes of light
- Sleep deprivation can cause issues with alertness, motor speed, and anxiety, as well as a host of other issues
