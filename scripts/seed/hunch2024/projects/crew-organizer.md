## Problem

The crew quarters on the ISS are small and have limited storage space. The crew members have reported that the current storage solutions are not adequate and that they have difficulty keeping their personal items organized. The crew members have requested new organizers that are more functional and provide better storage and organization options. The organizers should be designed to fit the current crew quarters on the ISS and should be compatible with the current storage and organization procedures.
