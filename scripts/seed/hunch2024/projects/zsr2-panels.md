## Problem

The ZSR2 panels in the ISS crew quarters are uncomfortable and difficult to clean. The ZSR2 panels are used to provide privacy and comfort while working and sleeping in microgravity. The current ZSR2 panels are made of a material that is not comfortable and does not provide enough privacy. The crew members have reported that the ZSR2 panels are uncomfortable and difficult to clean. The crew members have requested new ZSR2 panels that are more comfortable, provide better privacy, and are easier to clean and maintain.
